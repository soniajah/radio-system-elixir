# PostgreSql schema

A device profile is a record containing the following information (example):
```javascript
{
    id: 1,
    alias: "Radio1",
    allowed_locations: ["CPH-1", "CPH-2"],
    location: "CPH-1"
}
```

* Create new radio : `POST /radios/{id}`

Payload (JSON)
```javascript
{
    "alias": string,
    "allowed_locations": array<string>
}
```
`Returns 200 OK when id does not already exist`

* Set a location : `POST /radios/{id}/location`
Payload (JSON)
```javascript

{
    "location": string
}
```

* Retrieval of a radio’s location : `GET /radios/{id}/location`
